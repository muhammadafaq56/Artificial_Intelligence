#In Python, a comment starts with a hash symbol (#) and extends to the end of the line. The interpreter ignores everything after #. Comments help explain code but do not affect execution. Python does not support multi-line or block comments
# Here is a code of pyton, which is ignored because # is used
# print("Hello, World!")
